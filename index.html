			 Before he got into politics, Mark Levine was teaching bilingual math and science at Junior High School 149 in the South Bronx. He was elected twice to represent the 7th City Council District. Levine won the 2021 election for Manhattan Borough President and he assumed office in January 2022. He's currently the Democratic nominee for Comptroller.

			<h2>Solving The Housing Crisis In New York City.</h2>
			<p>
				As Manhattan Borough President, Levine passed <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3673428&GUID=4205F42E-82F7-4976-8BF7-035AE2B5B16D&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search" target="_">legislation</a> guaranteeing a right to council for tenants facing eviction in New York City's housing courts. This protection helped many New Yorkers avoid eviction and stay in their homes. Levine helped create thousands of residential units in Manhattan, reform outdated zoning laws, and identify opportunities for tens of thousands of new homes.
			</p>

			<p>
				In an Op-Ed <a href="https://www.amny.com/opinion/affordable-housing-hidden-in-plain-sight/" target="_"> article</a>, Levine said,"the proposed Midtown South rezoning, which I called for in my "Housing Manhattanites" plan, would unlock the potential for new housing across 42 blocks and dozens of underutilized commercial buildings ripe for conversion. This single change could lead to the creation of more than 9,000 new homes from a mix of conversions and new construction-including 2,800 permanently affordable units."

			<h2>Repairing Our Mental Health System.</h2>
			<p>
				If he gets elected as Comptroller, Levine wants to address the staffing shortages at mental health facilities by improving pay and working conditions for psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals. Furhtermore, Levine proposes a <a href="https://www.votemarklevine.com/issues/fixing-our-broken-mental-health-system" target="_"> plan</a> to increase the number of impatient psychiatric care beds and invest in proven initiatives that get people into the care that they need, like Intensive Mobile Treatment, Assertive Community Treatment, and Community Behavioral Health Clinics.
			</p>

			<p>
				According to his <a href="https://www.amny.com/opinion/breaking-the-mental-health-crisis-cycle/" target="_"> Op-Ed</a> published in amNY, Levine said "impatient beds matter. Rather than risking patients in crisis being discharge back into the streets, impatient care offers space for patients with sudden or severe symptoms to recieve structured care tailored to their needs through medication adjustments, therapy and close monitoring by experienced professionals."

			<h2> Fighting Climate Change </h2>
			<p>
				Levine's track record of combating climate change includes, campaigning for trees to be planted across New York City, demand that greenways across the city are completed, and ensure that Local <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/buildings/codes/ll97-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reductions.page" target="_"> Law </a> 97 is properly implemented. If he's elected Comptroller, Levine will divest city pension funds from fossil fuels, invest in renewable energy, and audit agencies that fail to meet climate goals.

		<h2> Paying Contractors On Time </h2>
		<p>
			Levine proposes a plan that reforms procurement and payment rules, requiring specific timelines for agencies to provide payment and more. According to his campaign <a href="https://www.votemarklevine.com/issues/paying-human-service-organizations-on-time" target="_"> website </a>, he wants to eliminate payment delays for clerical and small disputes, require strict timelines for contracts to be submitted for registration, elevate's the Mayor's Office of Contract Services to a full agency, grade every city agency on M/WBE procurement, contracting, and equity standards, and have comptroller control of the procurement policy board.
